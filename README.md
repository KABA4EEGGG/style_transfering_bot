## Description
This is a telegram bot for image styling.It uses a generative neural network for this.The principle of operation is that the bot receives two images and transfers the style from one to the other.
The neural network I used [MSG-net](https://github.com/zhanghang1989/PyTorch-Multi-Style-Transfer) by [zhanghang1989](https://github.com/zhanghang1989).
